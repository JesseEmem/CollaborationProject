Student Information System ( A sample Web App using CodeIgniter)
###################

This is an example source code in developing a web application with CodeIgniter.

This simple ecommerce website was developed as class project and it composed 7 modules handled by 7 teams. In reallity its very hard to handle control and even guide people with different backgrounds and different schedules and attitudes. the code are updated only by the few but collaborated by many brains. implementation is very hard but because of the desire to graduate we must do it. 

HInulata lang sa ta kinsay mo update sa dapat i update. Due date is April 3, 2019. God bless us all...
